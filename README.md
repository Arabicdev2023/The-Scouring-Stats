| **Tip** | **Details** |
|---------|------------|
| **Where do skeletons spawn?** | Skeletons spawn at night in sectors where players or their buildings have a presence. They do not spawn directly near the player but rather in unseen locations within active sectors. |
| **How many skeletons spawn?** | The number of skeletons depends on player presence in a sector and accumulated deaths. More player units and buildings increase skeleton spawns. If player units die in a sector, skeleton spawn rates increase. |
| **How do skeletons spawn?** | They appear in unseen areas using a search pattern to find walkable, unobserved terrain. If an eligible spot is found, a skeleton is placed there. |
| **How to reduce skeleton spawns?** | Try to have full vision over your area to limit the spawn direction of skeletons to a specific location where you don't have vision (fog of war). |
| **Do skeletons target anything specific?** | No, they do not specifically seek out players but are spawned in response to player presence. Their numbers are influenced by past engagements in a sector. |  

| **Tip** | **Details** |
|---------|------------|
| **What causes starvation?** | Starvation occurs when your food production is lower than food consumption. If you run out of food, your units will start to suffer penalties. |
| **How is food produced?** | Food is generated by peasants assigned to farming. Each farm produces a fixed amount of food. |
| **How much food do units consume?** | Every unit type has a food cost that contributes to overall consumption. More military units increase food consumption. |
| **What happens when starving?** | Starving units **slow down** and **take damage over time** until they reach 1 HP. |
| **Can you still make units while starving?** | Yes, as long as you have enough resources, but new units will also suffer from the starvation penalties. |
| **How to prevent starvation?** | Always have enough peasants farming. If your food supply is low, **prioritize building farms** before training more units. |
